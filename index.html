    <h1><b>We Are Protopians!</b></h1>
        <h2>Protyping A New Way Of Living</h2>
            <h3>We have the chance to utilize technology as a liberatory force.</h3>
                <p>We can live in abundance, we have the technology. We just need to start building the hardware we need to build a new way of living. Luckly through Open Source Ecology we have the knowlege at our figertips, we just need to start building it.</p>
                <p>As protopians we are commited to orgainizing and developing decentalized communities that are self sufficent and harmonious with nature. A cohousing model can be inmplemented with a worker owned cooperative, to build affordable hosing that also provided community and income.</p>
